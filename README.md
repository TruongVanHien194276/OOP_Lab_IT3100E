# Object-Oriented Programming Lab (IT3100E)

The **Object-Oriented Programming Lab (IT3100E)** is designed to provide hands-on experience in applying Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts using java language. This lab aims to reinforce the theoretical knowledge of OOP by focusing on practical coding exercises, real-world problem-solving, and project development.

## Key Objectives
- Develop a strong understanding of OOP concepts and methodologies.
- Apply design principles such as SOLID, DRY, and modularity in code.
- Implement object-oriented solutions to complex problems through practical assignments.
- Enhance skills in debugging, testing, and optimizing OOP-based programs.
- Foster collaboration and teamwork through group projects and peer reviews.

## Lab Structure
1. **Introduction to OOP**: Understanding classes, objects, constructors, and destructors.
2. **Encapsulation and Abstraction**: Implementing access modifiers, getters/setters, and abstract classes.
3. **Inheritance**: Creating subclass-superclass relationships, and understanding method overriding and overloading.
4. **Polymorphism**: Working with interfaces, dynamic method dispatch, and runtime polymorphism.
5. **Exception Handling**: Writing code with robust error and exception-handling mechanisms.
6. **File I/O Operations**: Performing file input/output operations using OOP principles.
7. **Advanced OOP Concepts**: Introduction to templates, iterators, and collections.
8. **Mini-Projects**: Developing small-scale applications using OOP to solve real-world problems.
